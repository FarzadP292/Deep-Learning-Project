# Deep-Learning-Project


In the first mini-project, we implement an image denoiser network using PyTorch. The used network architecture is a convolutional autoencoder that generates image-to-image mappings. The input and the target pairs of the training data are noisy images, and no clean reference is involved in the training process. This model is known as a Noise2Noise network https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04189
